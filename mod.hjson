description : "The torch was taken. Robbed of its original holder. After a while of chaos and misery, the thief was put to justice. Or so you and I thought. But he resurfaced, with a machine to tear this plane apart. It's time for us to do something...now.

Very DaF! based mod of the series' finale that I am revealing way too early(oops)."
