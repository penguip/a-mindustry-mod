localizedName: "Cave"
description: "In an undisclosed tunnel of the Windswept Islands is a small, narrow, and quiet cave. There are very little resources, but you are able to hide here. Unfortunately, the air in the cave is also extremely thick and murky. But the most unsettling part is the small grave all the way at the end. Perhaps you can search the grave for a special item."
